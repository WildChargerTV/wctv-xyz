            Welcome to my website. My name is WildCharger, creator of the most inconsistent content
            on the internet.
            <br /><br />
            Right now, this place is currently under construction. If you arrived here looking to
            contact me, please send an e-mail to <b>info@wildcharger.xyz</b>, or use the contact
            form on the Contact page.
            <br /><br />
            Once complete, the website will feature a more comprehensive expression of who I am & 
            what I&apos;ve done over the years, so if you&apos;re interested, feel free to check 
            back every so often in the event I am able to spruce this place up a bit better.
            <br /><br />
            Until then, thanks for visiting!
        </p>
