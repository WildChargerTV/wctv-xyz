        <p>
            Here you can find a rough culmination of my active & upcoming publicly announced
            projects. Use the tabs shown above to switch between available categories. My focus has
            historically been on video gaming; so I figured it would be easiest to sort the tabs
            themselves by their game of focus, with one tab reserved to describe my journey as a
            content creator.
            <br /><br />
            Note that in all tabs (except this one), <b>bold text indicates a link</b>!
            <br /><br />
            This page will be updated as my projects progress, so feel free to check back every so
            often!
